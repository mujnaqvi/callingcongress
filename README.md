Dial by zip for Members of Congress/Senate

7-13-2012

Why I made this
I find it funny that while almost every large organization has a dial-by-name or by extension directory, the U.S. Congress does not.  One can call the switchboards like (202) 224-3121 where an operator answers.  They then ask whom you want to be connected to, but what if you don’t who your officials are?  Seems to me we can automate this process to save money and time.

So I made this small dial-by-zip directory app using Ruby and Tropo.  I haven’t coded for years so this is my way to re-learn all the while empowering constituents.

I know there are some cool apps for the iPhone or Android that let you search and call your officials but this number can be used by anyone on any phone.

I also added a feature where it posts on twitter @CallingCongress when someone uses the service.  Basically it posts “a constituent called Representative XXXXX”

I’ll try to add more features like being able to call State officials and also being able to record a message so that during specific campaigns constituents can do a reverse “robocall” to the official.  This would be almost like a automated calling campaign.

My hope is that the startup and technical communities help our government be more efficient and accurate.
